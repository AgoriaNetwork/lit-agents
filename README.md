# LitAgents: Autonomous Digital Agents Platform
## Overview
LitAgents is a groundbreaking blockchain-based platform that enables the creation of autonomous digital agents through smart contracts on Base. These agents can operate independently through decentralized protocols, with their behavior, capabilities, and ownership managed transparently on-chain.

## Deployments
- **LitAgents Contract**: [0x957Ed109638c79e9A1ba8D03cC2CFa89115e0A9C](https://basescan.org/address/0x957Ed109638c79e9A1ba8D03cC2CFa89115e0A9C)
- **Test Agent Wallet**: [0x68Dbf33AE3D6730fb8206f11901e344F971a1b37](https://basescan.org/address/0x68Dbf33AE3D6730fb8206f11901e344F971a1b37)

## Core Architecture
1. **Autonomous Agent Framework**:
   - Self-executing smart contracts that manage agent lifecycle and behavior
   - Decentralized computation layer for independent task processing
   - Resource management system for sustained operation
   - Upgradeability patterns for evolution of agent capabilities

2. **Onchain Governance**:
   - Transparent ownership management through ERC-721 tokens
   - Configurable permission systems for agent control
   - Upgrade mechanisms for adding new features and behaviors
   - Multi-signature governance options for shared ownership

3. **Technical Components**:
   - **Smart Contracts**: Solidity contracts on Base for agent management
   - **Lit Protocol**: Decentralized compute network for autonomous execution
   - **AI Integration**: OpenAI and Replicate APIs for agent intelligence

## Key Features
- **Autonomous Operation**: Agents continue functioning without human intervention
- **Resource Self-Management**: Built-in mechanisms for managing compute and storage resources
- **Flexible Ownership**: Transparent transfer and management of agent ownership
- **Upgradeable Architecture**: Extensible design allowing agents to evolve over time
- **Decentralized Infrastructure**: No central points of failure or control

## Technology Stack
- **Blockchain**: Solidity, Base L2
- **Compute Layer**: Lit Protocol
- **Storage**: IPFS
- **AI Services**: OpenAI, Replicate
- **Development**: TypeScript, Node.js

## Getting Started
1. **Install Dependencies**:
```bash
git clone git@github.com:AgoriaNetwork/lit-agents.git
cd lit-agents
pnpm install
```

2. **Deploy Agent Contract**:
```bash
pnpm hardhat deploy --network base
```

3. **Create Autonomous Agent**:
```bash
pnpm create-agent --config agent-config.json
```

## Usage Examples
1. **Deploy Autonomous Agent**:
```typescript
const agent = await LitAgents.create({
  initialBehavior: "data-processing",
  resourceConfig: {
    computeUnits: 1000,
    storageGB: 10
  },
  upgradeability: true
});
```

2. **Transfer Ownership**:
```typescript
await agent.transferOwnership(newOwnerAddress);
```

3. **Upgrade Agent Capabilities**:
```typescript
await agent.upgrade(newImplementation);
```
